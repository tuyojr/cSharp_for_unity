## Programming Assignment: It's Elemental

### Assignment Description

You’ve decided that Chemistry is an awesome field to explore. Since we recently celebrated the 150th anniversary of Mendeleev’s periodic table of the elements, you decide to go look at the (current) periodic table of the elements. You’re so excited by the beauty and elegance of that arrangement that you decide to print out the symbols for the first 10 elements in the periodic table of the elements.

Open the project in Visual Studio.

Important: You MUST only add code as indicated by the comments in that file. If you don't, you're virtually guaranteed to fail all the test cases in the automated grader.

### Requirements

Your solution must do the following:

Print the symbol for each of the first 10 elements of the periodic table, with each symbol appearing on its own line in the output

Do NOT print anything else in your output; if you do, you’ll confuse the automated grader and you’ll get a bad grade!

In case you’re having a hard time understanding what your output should look like, here are the first 3 lines of required output (you’ll have 10 lines of output):

```TXT
H
He
Li
```

Important Note: The Coursera formatting makes it look like there's a blank line between each of the lines above, but there's not. The above example output is exactly 3 lines of output.

### Running Your Code

Because of the code I included to work with the automated grader on Coursera, when you run your program the command prompt window will open and it will sit there doing nothing. To make your code run, type 1 and press the `Enter` key; your code should then run so you can check your output.

You can actually run your code again if you want to by typing 1 and pressing the `Enter` key again. When you’re ready to stop running your code, type q (for quit).
